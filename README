NAME

Devel::CallChecker - custom op checking attached to subroutines

DESCRIPTION

This module makes some new features of the Perl 5.14.0 C API available to
XS modules running on older versions of Perl.  The features are centred
around the function "cv_set_call_checker", which allows XS code to attach
a magical annotation to a Perl subroutine, resulting in resolvable calls
to that subroutine being mutated at compile time by arbitrary C code.
This module makes "cv_set_call_checker" and several supporting functions
available.  (It is possible to achieve the effect of "cv_set_call_checker"
from XS code on much earlier Perl versions, but it is painful to achieve
without the centralised facility.)

This module provides the implementation of the functions at runtime
(on Perls where they are not provided by the core), and also at compile
time supplies the C header file which provides access to the functions.
