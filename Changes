version 0.001; 2011-04-11

  * bugfix: use PERL_CALLCONV to achieve consistent ABI across compilers

  * port to Windows (GCC toolchain) and Cygwin, where additional linker
    magic is required to make importation from shared object work (MSVC
    and BCC on Windows presumably still don't generate the linkable
    version of the shared library)

version 0.000; 2011-04-03

  * initial released version
