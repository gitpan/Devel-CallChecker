version 0.004; 2012-02-01

  * in documentation, clarify that the header and linkable functions
    should be called at build time

  * add B::CallChecker to "see also" list

  * update tests to accept Perl 5.15.7's modified panic error messages

  * in Build.PL, declare incompatibility with pre-0.19
    B::Hooks::OP::Check, which doesn't play nicely around op check hooking

  * convert .cvsignore to .gitignore

version 0.003; 2011-05-29

  * bugfix: set up CV name links correctly for error messages from
    prototype checkers

  * bugfix: don't leak temporary GVs and CVs in prototype checkers

version 0.002; 2011-05-19

  * add callchecker_linkable constant to help users link with this module

  * fully document the C functions

  * avoid false test failures with parallel testing

  * correct abstract line

version 0.001; 2011-04-11

  * bugfix: use PERL_CALLCONV to achieve consistent ABI across compilers

  * port to Windows (GCC toolchain) and Cygwin, where additional linker
    magic is required to make importation from shared object work (MSVC
    and BCC on Windows presumably still don't generate the linkable
    version of the shared library)

version 0.000; 2011-04-03

  * initial released version
